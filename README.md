# Movie-recommendation

This model uses collaborative filtering technique to recommend movie for a particular user based on the ratings of another user who rates movies similarly or has same taste of movies. I used the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) website where these datasets are available for free.
